> I was just chilling in the UCC clubroom on the 4th of February, when some weirdo messaged me to let them in at around 12:50 pm. They were wearing mismatched coloured clothes, a face mask with a beaver on it, dad sandals and a massive whiteboard. All he did was just stand in the middle of the club room for a few minutes then left. What a bizarre experience!

The UCC clubroom is recorded by a webcam on [this site](https://webcam.ucc.asn.au/archive.html#1643939616000). On the site adjust the time to 12:53pm to get the flag.

The flag is `ISS{UCC_COLAB}`
